With Motif, I want to build a theory of the case for a new style of software development, something I'm thinking of as ["high-altitude" development](/blog/haste).

I'm a software engineer with a passion. I love the art and craft of building software. The full spectrum of tools and techniques, platforms and politics, the emotions, the successes and the failures.

I have a lot of thoughts and I want to cover a lot of ground. I'll present some [concepts](/blog/tag/concept) from the software industry, explain Motif's [mission](/blog/mission) and [principles](/blog/tag/principle), and tie theory to practice with some [examples](/blog/tag/example). Most of all, I want to introduce some novel ideas and open the doors to a new generation of software engineers.

This has been a long time coming, so an initial dump of thoughts will be followed by a process of incremental refinement. Refined ideas will then be implemented in [projects](/projects/).

I also want to keep it short and to-the-point (a constant struggle). So, until next time.
